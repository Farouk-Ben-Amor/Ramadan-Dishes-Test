create a new variable name it doneCookingTime and store inside it the maghrib prayer time minus 15 min ,
then create another variable startCookingTime and store inside it doneCookingTime - dish.duration , 
then comparing that generated time with the asr prayer time , 
if startCookingTime came later than asr prayer then create another variable named timing 
and store inside it startCookingTime - asr prayer (this duration in minutes) and display 'timing minutes after asr',

if startCookingTime came earlier than asr prayer then create another variable named timing 
and store inside it asr prayer - startCookingTime  (this duration in minutes) and display 'timing minutes before asr',

==>Example1 : (for the sentence after asr)
asrTime = 15:28
maghribTime = 17:50
dish.duration = 30 min
doneCookingTime = 17:50 - 15 = 17:35
startCookingTime = 17:35 - 30 = 17:05
if(startCookingTime(17:05) >(later than) asrTime(15:28) ) : which is true
timing =  17:05 - 15:28 = 97 min
->97 minutes after asr.


==>Example2 : (for the sentence before asr)
asrTime = 15:28
maghribTime = 17:50
dish.duration = 155 min
doneCookingTime = 17:50 - 15 = 17:35
startCookingTime = 17:35 - 155 = 15:00
if(startCookingTime(17:05) (earlier than) < asrTime(15:28) ) : which is true
timing = 15:28 - 15:00 = 28 min
->28 minutes before asr.
